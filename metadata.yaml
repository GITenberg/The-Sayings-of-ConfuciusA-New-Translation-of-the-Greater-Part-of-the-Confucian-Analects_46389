description: '<i>The Analects</i> is a compilation of ethical pronouncements attributed
  to the ancient Chinese scholar and teacher Kung Fu-Tse, known in the West as Confucius.
  Confucius felt that society had been drifting into moral decay for at least 200
  years before his birth, and his life''s effort was an attempt to reverse this trend
  for he maintained that we, as humans, are capable of handling our own problems without
  the aid of Divine assistance. This is the only work attributed to Confucius, and
  it is, in fact, the labor of his students, who compiled his moral maxims in <i>The
  Analects</i> after his death in 479 B.C. '
